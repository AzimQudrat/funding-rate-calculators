A variety of funding rate calculators.

Please considers supporting me through affiliate links:
Bybit: https://www.bybit.com/en/invite/?ref=WLPB8MK

HTX: https://www.htx.com/en-us/v/register/double-invite/web/?inviter_id=11345710&invite_code=97nca223

These calculators access the exchange API or coinanaylze to get the last 3 days of funding and getting the average over these 3 days. For Bybit and Hyperliquid you will need to make API keys. 

To make an API key on Bybit go to -> https://www.bybit.com/app/user/api-management
To make a coinalyze API key go to -> https://coinalyze.net/account/api-key/

These calculators will return via a .txt file and they will be sorted in highest to lowest. Please reach out if there are any issues @https://x.com/quantzim

Remember you will need to be short if funding is positive and long if funding is negative.
